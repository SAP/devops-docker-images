# Jenkins agent k8s

This is a docker version of Jenkins JNLP agent which is an extension to [jenkinsci/jnlp-slave](https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jnlp-slave/).

The `ppiper/jenkins-master` runs with a user id `1000`.
Hence, a user `piper` with uid `1000` has been added to the JNLP agent. This will avoid the possible issue with the access rights of the files that needs to be accessed by both master and the agent. 

This image is intended to be used in Jenkins pipelines.
