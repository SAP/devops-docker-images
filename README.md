## Description

This is a collection of [_Dockerfiles_](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) for images that can be used in _Continuous Delivery_ (CD) pipelines 
for SAP development projects. The images are optimized for use with project ["Piper"](https://github.com/SAP/jenkins-library) on [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/). Docker containers simplify your CD tool setup, encapsulating 
tools and environments that are required to execute pipeline steps.

If you want to learn how to use project "Piper" please have a look at [the documentation](https://github.com/SAP/jenkins-library/blob/master/README.md). Introductory material and a lot of SAP scenarios not covered by project "Piper" are described in our [Continuous Integration Best Practices](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/ci-best-practices-intro.html).

**Note:** This repository has been split up.
Please refer to the following repositories for current Dockerfiles and documentation:

* [Cx Server](https://github.com/SAP/devops-docker-cx-server)
    * Jenkins master
    * Jenkins agents
    * Cx Server companion
* [CF cli](https://github.com/SAP/devops-docker-cf-cli)
* [Neo cli](https://github.com/SAP/devops-docker-neo-cli)
* [MTA Builder](https://github.com/SAP/devops-docker-mta-archive-builder)
* [Node browsers](https://github.com/SAP/devops-docker-node-browsers)
