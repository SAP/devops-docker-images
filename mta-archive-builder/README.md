This image can be used to build SAP Multitarget Applications (MTA) containing Java and Node.js modules.

# How to use this image

On a linux machine you can run 

`docker run -v `pwd`:/project --rm mta-archive-builder mtaBuild --version`

This will execute the MTA archive builder and print its version information.

`docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/project -it mta-archive-builder:latest mtaBuild --mtar dummy.mtar --build-target NEO build`

This will build an `mtar` file for SAP Cloud Platform (Neo). The folder containing the project needs to be mounted into the image at `/project`.
